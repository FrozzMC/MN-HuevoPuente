# Do you need a plugin that recreates the function of the Bridge Egg and
# the Bridge Ball? You found what you were looking for! This lightweight
# plugin is going to make your life easier if your Bedwars plugin isn't
# working correctly or if you have plans to create a minigame. And the
# best part is that it's editable!

# This is my first plugin, I will greatly appreciate your reviews.
